# EXP
This is an addon to track exp/tnl's for all jobs so a user can see tnl's on their jobs without having to switch to that job. I've added the ToAU jobs here as they will be coming to Horizon eventually.

### Version 1.1
- Added command '/exp tnl' to swap between displaying each job's tnl and each job's current exp earned

### Version 1.0
- Has command '/exp' to hide/show the GUI
- Has a built in 10 second delay on update
- If you have a lv75 job the display will update to show current merits/limit points as well
