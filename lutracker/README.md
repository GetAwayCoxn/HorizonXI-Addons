# LuTracker
This is a small basic addon to help track your progress on trading in moat carps for the Lu Shang's Fishing Rod.

### Version 1.0
- Has commands '/lut' or '/lutracker' to hide/show the GUI
- Includes adjustable price (per stack) input to give estimated cost remaining
- Automatically adjusts total traded moat's when trading either brother (doesn't work correctly if you trade Forest carps currently)
- Talking to the brother you are helping or Ufanne will update/adjust your total traded in count (useful if you do end up trading in Forest carps)
