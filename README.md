# HorizonXI-Addons
This repo is for my addons that are HorizonXI (or other private servers at 75 cap) focused. Each addon should have it's own README with information specific to that addon. These addons although intended to not break any Horizon community rules may or may not be on the current "approved" addon list. If someone wants to go through the process to get them approved that's fine by me but I won't be the one to take the time to do it.

I will say that if you find any of my retail addons they will almost certainly get you banned so do not use any of my addons that aren't not in this specific HorizonXI-Addons repo on the Horizon XI server. Whether you play on Horizon, or any other private server, or even retail for that matter, I am not responsible for you or your character(s) so use at your own risk.

For any questions or bugs or what not you can create an isse ticket here on github or find me on the Ashita discord server pretty easily as well.
