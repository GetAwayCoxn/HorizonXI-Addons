# Updated Petinfo
This addon is the original work of atom0s and Tornac with only slight modifications by myself. I added a timer display for beastmaster pets so a player can see how much longer they have on their jug pet. I am not sure how useful this would be for retail players so I have not tried to PR this into ashita's main project but thought I could share it here at least.
